# Semantic Encyclopedias

These slides were created by [Trevor Lazarus](http://trevorlazar.us) from [NDW](http://www.n-dw.co/)

### Resource Description Framework
* RDF Language
  * Language for **representing data** on the Semantic Web
  * Language for expressing **simple statements** of the form subject-predicate-object(aka Binary Predicates)
  * Gives us the capability to perform **inference on statements**
  * Flexible data model, no worries if the schema changes!

* RDF Data Model
  * The data model in RDF is a **graph data model**
  * An edge with two connecting nodes forms a **triple**
  *  .right[![Right-aligned image](https://objectcomputing.com/files/7214/3777/2560/triples.gif)]

## Resource Description Framework

* Representing things  as **Facts** to _infer_ new **Facts**
 * Fact 1:

#### Dissecting an Entry

<!-- .left[![Right-aligned image]()] -->

## From formatted Word/PDF to RDF

* Extract text and content metadata
  * Extract and match headwords to the entry and authors based on formatting or based on positioning.

* Create identifiers for entries, authors, etc.

* Create triples linking Authors to their entries, etc.

* Grounding of Appendix and selected bibliography to existing LOD cloud _**(Important)**_

* Extracting Temporal Data.
* Extracting Spatial Data

* Named Entity Recognition
* Topic Modelling **_(Not in Budget)_**

---

## Infrastructure
* Customer might either want to host it on their own servers or with one of the cloud providers(AWS, Google, Azure, etc.)
 * Would need to check requirments if it's on premise, Debian-like OS, Java, php, MySQL, etc.
* Setup and load facts into a SPARQL endpoint
 * Fuseki, Dereferencing interface, staging environments, settle on the domain name.
* Setup Robust installation of Drupal 8 on our staging environment:
 * Reverse Proxy and HTTP caching layer - Varnish
 * NGINX Webserver
 * MariaDB/Postgres Database server
 * php7 with necessary modules
 * Docker with nodejs container
* Content Enhancement Engine
 * Apache Stanbol with chained content enhancers
* Create Roles and a Permissions matrix for various users of the site:
 * EiC, Assistant Editors, Editorial Board Members, Guest Editors, Reviewers, Authors, etc.
---
## Theming

 * Create Drupal Theme to match chosen design

  * Designer to show a few possible layouts

  * Customer to pick one.

  * HTML/CSS created to match the Design

  * Drupal Theme created using HTML/CSS from previous step

## Semantic Components
 * Geospatial:
  * Leaflet Tiles to match elizabethan era
  * Responsive container that can be placed whereever it makes sense.

 * Temporal Components
  * Timeline

 * Spatio-Temporal Components
  * Events linked to Places
  * Space and Time in context

 * Thematic Components
  * Identify various themes related to the Encyclopedia
  *

---
## Semantic Content Editing Workflow:
* Auto-recommended Tagging using Content Enhancement Engine
 * Recommends Tags based on content entered by the Authors
 * Authors can choose from the list of Tags
.left[![Right-aligned image](https://www.drupal.org/files/auto_recommended_tags.gif)]
* Tags are automatically grounded to URIs(Concepts, Entities, etc.) within the Knowledge graph
* Content along with Tags is automatically entered as a node and the extracted facts as triples to the SPARQL endpoint

## Describing the previous network visualization

  * Are Shakespeare’s tragedies all structured in the same way?

* Are the characters rather isolated, grouped, all connected?

* Narration, even fictional, contains a network of interacting characters.

* Constituting a well defined corpus, the eleven Shakespearean tragedies can easily be compared.

* Used here, a network visualization in which each character is represented by a node connected with the characters that appear in the same scenes.

* The result speaks for itself: the longest tragedy (Hamlet) is not the most structurally complex and is less dense than King Lear, Titus Andronicus or Othello.

* Some plays reveal clearly the groups that shape the drama: Montague and Capulets in Romeo and Juliet, Trojans and Greeks in Troilus and Cressida, the triumvirs parties and Egyptians in Antony and Cleopatra, the Volscians and the Romans in Coriolanus or the conspirators in Julius Caesar.
---
## In Conclusion

 * Setup Infrastructure (Tika, Drupal, Stanbol, Fuseki and Solr/LARQ)

 * Process Raw Data (Docx, PDF, CSV, etc) into RDF graphs

 * Ingest content into endpoint

 * Build UI for Drupal elements and Semantic Components

 * Integration and Testing

 * Staging and Production builds

 * Continuous Deployment

 * Maintenance retainer
