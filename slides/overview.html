# Semantic Encyclopedias

These slides were created by [Trevor Lazarus](http://trevorlazar.us/sem-enc) while at [Newgen](http://newgen.co)

### Resource Description Framework
* RDF Language
  * Language for **representing data** on the Semantic Web
  * Language for expressing **simple statements** of the form subject-predicate-object(aka Binary Predicates)
  * Gives us the capability to perform **inference on statements**
  * Flexible data model, no worries if the schema changes!

* RDF Data Model
  * The data model in RDF is a **graph data model**
  * An edge with two connecting nodes forms a **triple**

## Resource Description Framework

* Representing things  as **Facts** to _infer_ new **Facts**
 * Fact 1:

## Dissecting an Entry
.left[![Right-aligned image](https://github.com/trevorlazarus/semantic-encyclopedias/raw/master/slides/annotated_a.png)]
---

## From formatted Word/PDF to RDF

* Extract text and content metadata
  * Extract and match headwords to the entry and authors based on formatting or based on positioning.

* Create identifiers for entries, authors, etc.

* Create triples linking Authors to their entries, etc.

* Grounding of Appendix and selected bibliography to existing LOD cloud _**(Important)**_

* Extracting Temporal Data.
* Extracting Spatial Data

* Named Entity Recognition
* Topic Modelling **_(Not in Budget)_**

---

## Infrastructure
* Customer might either want to host it on their own servers or with one of the cloud providers(AWS, Google, Azure, etc.)
 * Would need to check requirments if it's on premise, Debian-like OS, Java, php, MySQL, etc.
* Setup and load facts into a SPARQL endpoint
 * Fuseki, Dereferencing interface, staging environments, settle on the domain name.
* Setup Robust installation of Drupal 8 on our staging environment:
 * Reverse Proxy and HTTP caching layer - Varnish
 * NGINX Webserver
 * MariaDB/Postgres Database server
 * php7 with necessary modules
 * Docker with nodejs container
* Content Enhancement Engine
 * Apache Stanbol with chained content enhancers
* Create Roles and a Permissions matrix for various users of the site:
 * EiC, Assistant Editors, Editorial Board Members, Guest Editors, Reviewers, Authors, etc.
---
## Theming

 * Create Drupal Theme to match chosen design
  * Designer to show a few possible layouts
  * Customer to pick one.
  * HTML/CSS created to match the Design
  * Drupal Theme created using HTML/CSS from previous step
---

## Semantic Components
 * Geospatial:
  * Leaflet Tiles to match elizabethan era
  * Responsive container that can be placed whereever it makes sense.

 * Temporal Components
  * Timeline

 * Spatio-Temporal Components
  * Events linked to Places
  * Space and Time in context

 * Thematic Components
  * Identify various themes related to the Encyclopedia
  *

---
## Semantic Content Editing Workflow:
* Auto-recommended Tagging using Content Enhancement Engine
 * Recommends Tags based on content entered by the Authors
 * Authors can choose from the list of Tags
.left[![Right-aligned image](https://www.drupal.org/files/auto_recommended_tags.gif)]
* Tags are automatically grounded to URIs(Concepts, Entities, etc.) within the Knowledge graph
* Content along with Tags is automatically entered as a node and the extracted facts as triples to the SPARQL endpoint
